# cryptography-and-hashing
A hands-on, step-by-step course repository covering modern cryptography and hashing. Learn the theory and build working implementations in both Python and Java, then explore practical cryptanalysis to understand real-world strengths and weaknesses—responsibly.

## What You’ll Learn
- Symmetric (private key) and asymmetric (public key) cryptosystems
- Modular arithmetic, randomness, primes, and core number-theory problems
- Classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenère, One-Time Pad) and how to analyze/crack them
- Modern block ciphers (DES, AES) and cryptanalysis basics
- Key exchange (Diffie–Hellman), RSA, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Cryptographic hashing: properties, birthday paradox, MD5, SHA

## Course Outline
1. Fundamentals: aims of cryptography; private vs public key systems  
2. Caesar Cipher: theory, implementation, frequency analysis, cracking  
3. Vigenère Cipher: theory, implementation, Kasiski examination  
4. One-Time Pad (Vernam): randomness, XOR, Shannon’s secrecy  
5. DES: theory, implementation, linear/differential cryptanalysis  
6. AES: theory, implementation, confusion and diffusion  
7. Asymmetric Systems: limitations of symmetric crypto; randomness & primes  
8. Modular Arithmetic: basics, prime finding, factorization, discrete log  
9. Diffie–Hellman: theory, implementation, primitive roots, MITM risks  
10. RSA: theory, implementation, factorization challenges  
11. Advanced Modular Arithmetic: GCD, EGCD, modular inverse  
12. ECC: theory, implementation, why Bitcoin uses ECC  
13. Hashing: properties, birthday paradox, MD5/SHA families

## Getting Started
- Requirements: Python 3.8+ and a recent JDK (e.g., Java 17+)
