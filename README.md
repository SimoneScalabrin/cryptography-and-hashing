Cryptography and Hashing Fundamentals in Python and Java Private and Public Key Cryptosystems, DES, AES, Cryptoanalysis, RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Hashing

What you’ll learn:

Cryptography basics: goals, private-key vs public-key systems
Classical ciphers: Caesar and Vigenère, frequency analysis, Kasiski method
One-Time Pad: true randomness, XOR, Shannon’s secrecy
Block ciphers: DES and AES, confusion and diffusion, linear and differential cryptanalysis
Modular arithmetic: primes, factorization, discrete logarithms, GCD, EGCD, modular inverses
Key exchange and public-key crypto: Diffie–Hellman, RSA
Elliptic Curve Cryptography: theory, implementation, and why it’s used in Bitcoin
Cryptographic hashing: properties, birthday paradox, MD5 and SHA families
Features:

Implementations in both Python and Java
Clear, incremental explanations paired with code
Practical exercises and attack demonstrations for defensive understanding
Prerequisites:

Basic programming in Python and/or Java
Comfort with high-school algebra; some number theory helps
